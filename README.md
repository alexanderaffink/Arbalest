Download the executable game [here](https://github.com/LeverageAlex/Arbalest/raw/master/P-Seminar_Informatik.zip).  

This game was a school project in 11th and 12th class. Our team was made up of 11 students, who can be categorized in seven graphic designer, two "marketing guys", one level designer (Louis) and me, the main coder of this project.

I wrote >95% of the code, while Louis wholely designed the game with the tools i provided for him. My programming part included coding:
- the player object
- several enemies, e. g. a skeleton, a flying bat, a walking mushroom...
- all environment objects, e. g. flying moving plattforms, cactus trees...
- the shop system
- whole UI   

and a lot more.

Appart from "just coding" I had to ensure, that the graphic designers exactly get the idea of the graphics i demanded from them, which was quite challenging.

I have uploaded several images, so can get an idea of the game.

Overall it took me estimated over 400 hours from start to finish this project. It was a pretty fun and rich experience.
